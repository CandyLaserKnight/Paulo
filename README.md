Web Framework for legal professionals

NOTICE: I'm following a course to create a web framework on Golang so except a minnor changes all the merit of the code you will see here till I finish
the course is from Trevor Sawler and his go larabel course on Udemy.

The goal is to continue working on this project after finishing the course. Probably you notice I advance slow, my work keep my kinda busy so I enjoy
the code on my free time.
